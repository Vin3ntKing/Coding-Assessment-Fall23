## Project Description ##
A simple to-do list app with a few basic requirements


### Running the App

1. Start the back-end server:
- Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` directory.
- Run `node index.js` or `npm start` (if you've set up a start script in `package.json`).

2. Start the front-end development server:
- Open a new terminal and navigate to the `client/to-do-app` directory.
- Run `npm start`.

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to test the to-do list app. You should be able to add and remove items, and the items should persist after a page refresh.

## Deployment

- Deploy the React app to a static hosting service like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- Deploy the back-end server to a platform like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
